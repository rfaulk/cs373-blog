###What did you do this past week?
This week we learned about unpacking.

###What is in your way?
5 research papers I need to read before tomorrow.

###What will you do next week?
There will definitely be lost of cramming from the upcoming exam.

It was another hard week. Unfortunately, I had to miss class again due to an errant lab in my grad OS class.

With regards to SWE, this was a calm-before-storm week. No assignments, but there's an exam this coming Thursday.

The exam will be interesting. When I took OOP, the exams were purely programming, so they weren't that bad. C++ has a few quirks, but there's really not that much to study. For SWE, though, it looks like we may be asked about the readings. This means waaaay more study time. Python itself is a fairly friendly language, so I think the programming will be easier, but it'll be a struggle to find time to review/read-for-first-time all the readings on top of everything else.


**Tip of the week:** Read man pages (by typing *man command*. They can seem arcane and useless at times, but there's a lot of great information.

Looking over *man python*, I discovered the -i flag which you can use to run a script in interactive mode. This gives you an interpreter with all of the functions from your module loaded, so it's a great way to hand-test your programs without having to do a bunch of imports.
